## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- Custom CSS using SASS
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flex-box
- CSS gap
- Mobile-first design

### What I learned

- overflow elements, gradients, positioning, sizing and positioning of background images and more ....

### Continued development

 I'd like to learn more of how to change the colors of an image that is already an svg.

### Useful resources

- [Google](https://www.google.com) - Probably **the** most valuable tool in a web developers arsenal, frontend or backend. Any search engine would do, though.
