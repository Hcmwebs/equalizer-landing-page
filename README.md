## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- Custom CSS using SASS
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flex-box
- CSS gap
- Mobile-first design
- Gulp

### What I learned

- overflow elements, gradients, positioning, sizing and positioning of background images and more ....

### Continued development

I'd like to learn more of how to change the colors of an image that is already an svg.

### Useful resources

- [Google](https://www.google.com) - Probably **the** most valuable tool in a web developers arsenal, frontend or backend. Any search engine would do, though.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com)- With all the challenges of background images that I have, this page came in handy for me. I learnt a lot about positioning and sizing of the background images.The **_Play it>>_**, helped me see the clear picture.

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) - After scratching my head for a while, I visited CSS-Tricks to learn more about changing colors of the svgs. It is amazing how fast and easy this is. Check out the **_Change Color of SVG on Hover_** article by [@chriscoyer](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier).

- **[Chris Coyer](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier)**: Without your clearly explained article on SVGs, I would still be scratching my head trying to figure out how to go about it. Thank you very much for sharing your knowledge through this and all your work.
